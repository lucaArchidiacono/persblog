# smolweb

smolweb is a TikTok UX styled browser for the small web. It lets you explore the internet as it was before the whole ad and AI ecosystem took over.

Swipe through personal blogs, tiny passion projects, and hidden corners of the internet written by real people with something to say.

No accounts. No tracking. No ads.
